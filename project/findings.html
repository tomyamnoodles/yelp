                To kick things off, we aimed to delve into the expansive domain of <b>Fear</b>. 
                Knowing that it's a broad topic to get into, 
                we sought a more specific path to navigate within this extensive subject. After much
                consideration, we decided to settle on texture aversion! We were drawn to
                the connection between visual imagery and the primal fear responses associated with certain
                textures, as imagination tends to take the wheel in times of fear.

                  Our initial idea was to showcase 3 sets of data collected through our blind
                  touch test: Fear rankings, Texture descriptions and Visual imagery. However, upon 
                  receiving Lecturers feedback, we realised that this was WAY. TOO. MUCH. INFORMATION.
                  So, we cut it down to just visual imagery, as it was the most interesting path.</p>

                The blind touch test we conducted gave us lots of interesting insights. Long, stringy materials, such as hair and udon, was a
                consistently most feared textures. Contrasting this, hard materials were least feared, highlighting a
                spectrum of tactile preferences. Surprisingly, soft and slimy materials garnered equal levels of fear,
                indicating a shared aversion. Notably, participants found the idea of materials being of human origin
                most repulsive, despite assurances of hygiene. <i>(anything that felt light to them scared them.)</i>

                Apart from the actual data collection, we learned one huge thing: WE CANNOT TRY TO FEED A WORM A SHANGRI-LA HOTEL BUFFET.
                In short, data visualisation is meant to make data easier to read. However, we tried to put in every single data we collected into our artefact, which would make our artefact look so overwhelming
                to the point where viewers cannot absorb anything. We had to prioritise data.

              <p>Based on the data collected from the blind touch test, we came up with different ways to showcase it in

                be inside the large circles.

                took part in the blind touch test was represented vertically. The size of the circles in this graph above was determined
                by the fear reaction of the participant. The larger the circle, the more scared/disgusted the participant was.

                We needed to find a way to visually represent the collected data while integrating all the materials to
                create a cohesive visual imagery. Given that our materials encompassed items like food that could spoil,
                we had to explore alternatives to replicate them within the artefact as well. The process involved
                translating these considerations into sketches to get a better understanding of the ideas.

                Additionally, we planned on creating a booklet that expanded on these sketches. The content of the
                booklet indicates what each part of the artefact represents in detail and describes how our data is
                visualised. Although this booklet was scrapped, it still created a better understanding of our though
                process when creating the artefact.

                The process of selecting a topic and choosing materials for the artefact was quite time-consuming. We
                spent a lot of the time trying to figure out ways to present the data for each material. We looked for a
                lot of substitutions due to the extensive use of food in the touch test. While searching for
                substitutes, we used a lot of clay, which can be freely shaped. However, the clay weighed a lot after it
                hardened, and it became heavy as the various ingredients were combined. These problems resulted in
                materials that could not be hung on the mobile.

                By week 14, we only finished three materials. After the feedback, we changed our approach to design the
                artefact. As we proceeded to create a photobook, we didn’t have to strictly rely on the mobile idea, and
                instead focused on creating the visual imagery. Hence, creating the last 3 artefacts was more
                time-efficient and we could still produce a high-quality outcome through the photographs, emphasising on
                textures.

                The flexibility to adapt and integrate feedback has been a key aspect of our project, ensuring that each
                phase contributes meaningfully to the overall narrative.

                The feedback we received throughout our project, particularly from Jo, played a pivotal role in shaping
                and refining our approach. Jo's insights, particularly as a trial participant in the touch test, proved
                to be valuable. Her suggestion to mix the materials into one, adding an element of unpredictability and
                heightened discomfort, significantly enhanced the impact of our experiment. We got participants' genuine
                reactions, ranging from disgust to fear, aiding the visual associations of their experiences.

                During our Week 14 presentation, the feedback prompted a critical reassessment of our project's
                direction. First, It was also stated that we shouldn't focus too specificly on the dataset collected in
                our physical artefacts too avoid having too much information.
                Recognizing that our efforts felt more like a collection of experiments rather than a cohesive final
                outcome, the suggestion to create a photobook emerged as a solution. This shift allowed us to
                consolidate our testing, data, and experimentation into a comprehensive archive, providing a visually
                compelling and unified representation of our journey.

                A huge roadblock we conquered was picking the data to display. We had a lot of issues
                in terms of clarity, and found that we were putting in too much data for something that was
                meant to be simple and readable.

              We found that the way to solve this was to really strip off all the details and go back to basics.
              This began with us double-confirming our objective. From there, we decided to prioritise what data was
              most important to us (visual imagery), which is how we solved our issue.
