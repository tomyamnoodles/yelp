                Our project went through various stages which produced a series of physical artefacts that were compiled
                into a photobook as a final outcome. The process began with researching on our topic of ‘texture
                aversions’ where we find out what kind of materials were commonly found to be 'disgusting' or
                'uncomfortable'. These materials were used for conducting a ‘Touch Test’, our data collection of visual
                imagery and fear level ranked by the participants. We also created data visualisations to help better
                understand and summarise our results.

                Creating the physical artefact itself was quite challenging and we went through many trials and errors.
                Each iteration refined our approach, leading to an artifact that represented the complexities of texture
                aversions. After creating the physical artefact, our project took a turn towards producing a photobook
                as our final outcome. Serving as an archival documentation of our experimentations, the photobook
                compiles and provides an archive of our journey through experimentation, ideation, and creation.

              <h2>PROPOSAL, BACKGROUND</h2>
              <p>
                Texture aversion, a subtle but significant aspect of sensory fear, often goes unnoticed amidst our
                everyday lives. As tactile beings, humans heavily rely on the senses of touch to navigate and understand
                the world around them. Many people experience discomfort with certain textures, like wet paper or sand,
                triggering anxiety. Despite its prevalence, texture aversion is less appreciated in psychology. The
                project seeks to uncover how common these aversions are and identify the textures causing discomfort.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
              <h2>PROPOSED OBJECTIVE</h2>
              <p>
                The project 'Touchy Terrors' explores the association of texture aversion with fear responses and visual
                imagery. It aims to identify commonly discomforting textures, assess the prevalence and intensity of
                texture aversions, and explore associated mental imagery. Targeting individuals aged 19-26, the project
                seeks to answer:
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold"> "What textures/materials are most uncomfortable to touch, and what do they visualize
                  when interacting with these materials?” </span>
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
              <h2>PROPOSED APPROACH</h2>
              <p>
                To start, we identified the textures, materials, and items most commonly found discomforting to touch.
                Our data collection method involves a 'Touch Test,' involving participants to touch these materials to
                investigate the connection between visual imagery and fear responses associated with texture aversion.
                In our initial approach, we aimed to create a data sculpture as our final outcome, but later on evolved
                into creating a photobook that compiled all our experiments from the physical artefact.

                To conduct our data collection process, we set up a space where participants can engage in a "Touch
                Test". 6 textures, materials, and objects were placed inside a box and hidden from the participant’s
                view, focusing solely on the tactile experience. Below were the materials we used:
              </p>
              <p>
                HARD MATERIALS: Wire sponge, Pineapple
                <br> SOFT MATERIALS: Moist soil, Hair + Tissues
                <br> SLIMY MATERIALS: Slime, Udon + pasta suace
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
              <p>
                Participants were asked to assess the intensity of each texture and rank their top most feared things
                during the test, along with the associated visual imagery.
              </p>

                Initially, we wanted to create a physical sculpture as a tangible representation of the data collection
                process. Our main focus is to emphasise the visual imagery from the data collected, and to incorporate
                the various textures and materials used. There were several things that we needed to plan out for the
                artefact.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <span class="bold"> Sculpture: </span> <span class="p__size-m"> Data Sculpture of 6 different sections,
                  1 section for each material. The data in each section is made up of ranking and number of people. Size
                  and height of each section can be used to indicate the intensity level. </span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold"> Mobile: </span> <span class="p__size-m">
                  Mobile: Total 6 strings representing each material touched, Each string has 20 sections representing
                  each person who touched it. These sections will vary in size according to reaction/rank. </span>
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
              <p>
                We ultimately decided to combine these two ideas into one <span class="bold"> "Mobile Sculpture”.
                </span> “The mobile sculpture would be an interactive artefact which includes 6 spheres representing 1
                material each. They are connected by a thread attached to a wooden frame, each section having different
                heights to indicate the different levels of fear, which includes three categories of fear: the highest
                area being the most feared, followed by medium, and the lower area as the least.
              </p>
              <p>
                As previously created on the data visualisation, we expanded on the ongoing theme of ‘circles’. Using
                styrofoam spheres of different sizes, they were used as a base for each material. As for substituting
                the textures, some materials we experimented with were foam spray, clay and yarn. As our approached
                shifted in later parts of the project, this led to having 2 materials photographed in a specific
                location instead of the movile sculpture.

                Following the Week 14 presentation, we received valuable feedback that prompted a turn of ideas for our
                final outcome. It was stated that our artefacts as of that moment seemd more like a collection of
                testing and experimentation. Hence, the idea of creating a photo book of the physical artifact was
                suggested as a solution. Recognizing the visual appeal from photographs, we collectively agreed that
                this approach would elevate the overall presentation.

            <div class="col">
              <p>
                The decision to produce a photo book not only addressed the need for artefact a more cohesive and
                visually impactful outcome, but also allowed us to not be limited in a singular mobile structure. This
                shift also ensures a more accessible and engaging experience for those seeking to understand the nuances
                of our journey through experimentation and ideation.

                valuable insights and presented both successes and challenges. The data collection method of having the
                'Touch Test' served as an effective and engaging method for collecting data on texture aversions. It
                provided participants with a hands-on experience, allowing for a more authentic representation of their
                sensory reactions.

                As for what didn’t work as well, the mobile sculpture creation was quite time-consuming and involved a
                lot of experimentation. The weight problem encountered with certain materials, posed a significant
                challenge during the physical artefact creation.

                However, the photobook was a good solution to solve this problem as it allowed us to not be limited to
                the mobile. Thus, the visual elements of the photographs could capture the essence of our
                experimentation, and present it in a visually appealing and cohesive manner.

                Despite the challenges encountered, the project provided valuable insights into the intricate
                relationship between visual imagery and texture aversion. To improve, implementing a prototyping process
                may help address unforeseen challenges during the creation of physical artefacts, allowing for more time
                to be allocated to the photobook making.
